		Really Sorry for spamming your inbox!!!
	else
		Many a time I was forced to type this email by traffic bottlenecks and yeah "OPM" could have had its own contribution too. :P
		But however good work culture and challenging opportunities held me back from pressing "Enter" button.
		After much reflection, I have chosen to bid adieu to this lovely group of people to pursue new challenges in my field of interest. 
		
		I would like to mention that it has been great to interact with everyone of you. The good times we’ve shared will always be etched in my memory
		Even though I am excited about my new role, every person I’ve worked with will be missed sorely.
		
		Once again, I wish my colleagues a bright future and success. I would like to extend my best wishes to the entire firm.
		
		"How Lucky I'm to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard".

Many Thanks,
Pranay
